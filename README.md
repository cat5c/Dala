# README

This webapp was completed by Catheryn Celaya, Enrique Calderas and Chris Turpin for Cohort 17's pitch day, at Wyncode Academy.

Dala is the product of a Wyntank pitch, which was given by Rodrigo Pecchio a student at FIU whom had a vision that his app would have the addictive qualities that rolly vortex or sliter.io have, with the beneficial factor of it being educational. 

The main page displays the user sign up or sign in, once completed you're now on the game level page, which includes 4 levels,  you can also check out the leaderboard and see where you rank in comparison with your friends. You start out with physics as your subject, each level has a different monster and background with subsequently harder questions, moving on to different subjects.

The site can be found at http://www.dalagame.co/
